This is the Pd port of the teabox~ Max/MSP externals.

In order to run it you have to load it as a library. Start Pd
with the '-lib path/to/teabox' flag. In case this worked correctly
you can use the objects 'teabox~', 'teabox.bits~' and 'teabox.count~'
like any normal Pd object.
The provided makefile should work for all plattforms that Pd is 
currently running on.
